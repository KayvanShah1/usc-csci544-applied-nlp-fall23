---

## Usage  

You need to install pytest from https://pypi.org/project/pytest/  
Dump your files in the out/ folder in this repository  
Type the following in the terminal while being in the directory containing README.md

```
pytest
```

If your files are appropriate, then you will get an output saying "17 test cases passed"
Otherwise you will get a message that a few test cases have failed.

The "short test summary info" section of the output message will have the required messages that tell you what went wrong in one of your output files
